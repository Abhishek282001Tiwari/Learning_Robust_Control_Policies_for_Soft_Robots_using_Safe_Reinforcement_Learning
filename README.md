# Learning_Robust_Control_Policies_for_Soft_Robots_using_Safe_Reinforcement_Learning
Soft robots are hard to control due to unpredictable deformable behavior. This project uses safe reinforcement learning to develop robust control policies that can handle uncertainty while preventing damage through intelligent safety constraints.
