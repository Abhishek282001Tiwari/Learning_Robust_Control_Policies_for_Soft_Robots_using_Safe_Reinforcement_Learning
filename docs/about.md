# About This Research

## Problem Statement

Soft robots offer unique advantages in safe human-robot interaction, adaptability to complex environments, and resilience to damage. However, their inherent compliance and nonlinear dynamics present significant challenges for control system design. Traditional control approaches often struggle with:

- **Safety Constraints**: Ensuring the robot operates within safe deformation and force limits
- **Model Uncertainty**: Dealing with complex, time-varying dynamics of soft materials  
- **Environmental Disturbances**: Maintaining performance across different conditions
- **Real-time Control**: Achieving responsive control with computational constraints

## Research Motivation

Current reinforcement learning approaches for robotics often prioritize task performance over safety considerations. For soft robots operating in unstructured environments or near humans, this can lead to:

1. **Catastrophic Failures**: Exceeding material limits causing permanent damage
2. **Safety Violations**: Collisions or excessive forces that could harm users
3. **Unpredictable Behavior**: Policies that work in simulation but fail in reality
4. **Limited Robustness**: Poor performance under environmental variations

## Objectives

This research aims to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive framework for safe reinforcement learning in soft robotics:

### Primary Objectives
- Develop safety-aware RL algorithms that explicitly consider constraint satisfaction
- Create robust policies that maintain performance under model uncertainty
- Implement real-time safety monitoring and intervention mechanisms
- Validate the approach across multiple soft robot configurations

### Secondary Objectives
- Establish benchmarks for safe RL in soft robotics
- Provide open-source implementations for reproducible research
- Demonstrate scalability to different soft robot morphologies
- Create comprehensive documentation and educational resources
